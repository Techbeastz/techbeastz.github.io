When picking a book, look for one that:  
- **Speaks to your current season of life.** Different books hit differently depending on where you are.  
- **Feels relatable and actionable.** The best ones leave you inspired *and* ready to act.  
- **Stands the test of time.** Books that stay relevant for years usually do so for a reason.
